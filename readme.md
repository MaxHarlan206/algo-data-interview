# Algorithms, Data Structures, and Interview Questions:

**Hopefully this personal notepad of my solutions to common coding questions will give you some interview prep ideas as well**<br>
Most of these prep questions are my answers to questions from [Algo Expert](https://www.algoexpert.io/), a service you should absolutely purchase if you want to get interview ready quickly. 

## Run-Length Encoding 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2u_Z9mQcOc)<br>
Run length encoding is a type of encoding where duplicated sequential characters are encoded into 
a number and a letter. 
Ex. "AAFGGGGGGGGK" becomes 2A1F8G1K.

## Caesar Cipher Encryptor 
[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws5E2gCW4Hc)<br>
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the alphabet is replaced with a shifted one. For example, a shift of 3 would turn 'abc' into 'def' and 'wxy' would wrap around to become 'zab'.
This puzzle tests your ability to use the modulo operator among other things.
## Palindrome Checker 
[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCXrRuCthZY)<br>
Checking if a string is a palindrome (the same forward and backward) is an interesting challenge, because the obvious way of just creating a new, reversed list and checking
equality of the two is not the best answer from a space efficiency standpoint.
## Selection Sort
[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CykZVqBuCw)<br>
The selection sort iterates over an array of integers, finds the smallest one, and places it at the start of the array. 
Then it iterates over all values after the first integer, finds the lowest value, and places it second. Etc...
## Bubble sort
[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_xesqdQqvA)<br>
The bubble sort algorithm repeatedly iterates over pairs of values in an array of numbers and swaps them whenever it finds a higher value occuring earlier in the list. 
## Nth Fibonacci 
[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRhNi7a3zeI)<br>
The goal here is to find the Nth Fibonacci number. The fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, and then all subsequent digits are the sum of the previous two. 
## Monotonic array 
[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZPwlEWMMtM)<br>
Determine if an array is monotonic (strictly increasing with plateaus, or strictly decreasing with plateus) 
## Spiral traverse a matrix 
[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8b5KloiBhc)<br>
Starting at the top left corner of a list of lists, move in a spiral fasion and return a one dimensional array of the values in this path. 
There are many tempting but overcomplicated solutions to this one.
